# Getting and Cleaning Data | Course Project

## Overview
### The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. You will be graded by your peers on a series of yes/no questions related to the project. 

**You will be required to submit:**
- A tidy data set
- A link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis
- A code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md

- A README.md in the repo with your scripts.  This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.  



### The project data was collected from accelerometers in Samsung Galaxy S smartphones. 
**A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:**
[Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)


## Getting and Cleaning Data Repo Contents
- **README.md** &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This file
- **run_analysis.R** &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;R code for creating tidyData.txt file from collected smartphone data
- **codeBook.md** &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Describes variables, data, and raw data transformations


## Preparation Required to Execute run_analysis.R
1. Download UCI HAR Dataset.zip file from [website](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones) to your working directory
2. Set working directory in line 3 of run_analysis.R code before executing code file

**NOTE:** tidyData.txt will be saved to your working directory
